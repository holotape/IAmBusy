Displays your next meeting from an ICS file on a Waveshare epd2in13_V3 e-Ink display connected to a Raspberry Pi

Follow these instructions to get your RPi configured first:
https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT_Manual

Be sure to open up ics_link_sample.txt and follow the instructions.

If you are using a local Exchange server (as opposed to a Cloud one), this other project may help you retrieve your ICS file directly from the Outlook desktop client.
