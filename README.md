Displays your Outlook status on a Waveshare display connected to a Raspberry Pi.

# Everything below this line has not yet been updated from the original project which I am using as a basis for this: https://github.com/holotape/calendardisplay



Follow these instructions to get your RPi configured first:

Too long, don't want to read?
Do this.

```

```

Select Interfacing Options > SPI > Yes, enable SPI interface

# Important Bits

1. Adding your personal calendar

    Be sure to open up ics_link_sample.txt and follow the instructions to rename it and add the link or path to your calendar.

2. But I don't use Microsoft 365!

    If you are using a local Exchange server (as opposed to a Cloud one), this other project may help you retrieve your ICS file directly from the Outlook desktop client.

3. It's Upside-Down!

    If the image is upside-down, look for this line in the display_next_event.py file

    ```python
    FLIP_DISPLAY = True # Set this to False if you'd like to flip the display rightside-up
    ```
    Set that to False to flip it around.
